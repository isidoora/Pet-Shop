# Pet-Shop

Creating yearly sales report for a fictional pet shop.

I used MySQL for an analysis and Tableau Public to visualize data.
Here is the link to the [dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/isidora.p6049/viz/PetShop_17023258783260/Dashboard1)

The purpose of creating this report is solely to practice and the final results do not have practical applicability in real-life scenarios
The project is purely educational and intended for skill development.

Product table data is completely fictional while for the sales table I partly used data from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kyanyoga/sample-sales-data.
